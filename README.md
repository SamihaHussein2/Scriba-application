# MobileNet Lightweight CNN
MobileNet is specifically made for mobile and embedded vision applications. The main
layers of the MobileNet architecture are built on depthwise
separable convolutions that factorize a standard convolution
into a depthwise one, and a 1x1 convolution called ’pointwise
convolution’, which simplifies processing and makes
MobileNet suitable for mobile devices.

# Flutter software development kit
The app is developed using Flutter  to
be compatible with Android and iOS devices. 

# Dart Programming Language 
Dart is an object oriented programming language used in Flutter.

# Figma 
Figma is an online software used in designing wireframes and screens.

# Python 
Python is the language used in building the backend of scriba application, by implementing the MobileNet model to be trained and tested then get the best results to use the model in the processing of translation in the app.
